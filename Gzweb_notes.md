## Running GzWeb involves the following pieces:

* gzserver running the headless Gazebo simulation (runs by default on http://127.0.0.1:11345)

* GzWeb's NodeJS server which communicates with gzserver using Gazebo Transport. It works as a bridge between the Javascript and the C++ code.

* An HTTP server which serves static content such as models and website assets (icons, HTML, CSS, client-side Javascript...)

* A Websocket server which forwards simulation updates coming from gzserver to the browser

* A browser client which connects to the HTTP and websocket servers
